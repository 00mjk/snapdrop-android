## FAQ
#### Why do I need an app when file sharing is also working in my browser? 
Of course, you can also use your browser, but this app is much better integrated into the Android system. For example, it allows you to send files also from within other apps via the share action while all website functions are also supported inside the app...

#### Where can I download the app?
New releases are allways listed up at the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/fm-sys/snapdrop-android/releases/). If you prefer an F-Droid repo, you can use the binary repo [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=3BF0D6ABFEAE2F401707B6D966BE743BF0EEE49C2561B9BA39073711F628937A) which you can add to your F-Droid client. However, I take no responsibility for the content offered there.

## Contributing

snapdrop-android orriganally coded by [fm-sys](https://github.com/fm-sys) would like to become a community project. I invite your participation through issues and pull requests! There are still some things which need to be fixedâ€¦

Also bug reports are very wellcome! But note that this is not the right place to report bugs regarding the Snapdrop website which occur independently of this app.
