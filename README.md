# snapdrop-android
snapdrop-android is an android client for https://snapdrop.net/. Snapdrop is a free and open source local file sharing solution that works in your browser.

#### But why do I need an app when it works in my browser? 
Of course, you can also use your browser, but this app allows you to send files from other apps via the share action. All website functions are also supported inside the app...

#### Where can I download the app?
New releases are allways listed up [here](https://github.com/fm-sys/snapdrop-android/releases/). Don't forget to watch this repository in order to never miss a new version!

## Contributing

snapdrop-android orriganally coded by [fm-sys](https://github.com/fm-sys) would like to become a community project. I invite your participation through issues and pull requests! There are still some things which need to be fixedâ€¦

Also bug reports are very wellcome! But note that this is not the right place to report bugs regarding the Snapdrop website which occur independently of this app.
